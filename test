The very first concept was based on the idea of pushing, shifting, scrolling and clicking various buttons triggering a diverse mix of animations.  We then worked up different metaphors for dealing with money and at the same time used keywords the client had provided us. During the process the client fell in love with all the little \u201creaction\u201d stories so we ended up stitching them together to create a seamless narrative \u2014 open to interpretation and detached from conservative visualisations so often associated with banks. \n\nThe colour palette is based on the new CI of Comdirect, predominantly anthracite and grayscale. Yellow acts as the highlight colour with a gradient to green drawing the viewer\u2019s attention to the stories\u2019 heroes. The environment is based on dots, points and circles inspired by visual language used in the world of stock markets.  \n\nOur software package was Cinema 4D and Octane renderer.

Black and white photography allows us as the viewers to infer colors, to see contrast and requires us to look deeper into the photograph.  \n\nI have always been drawn to B&W photography. Whether it was the street photography of Henri Cartier-Bresson or the dramatic landscapes of Ansel Adams, the starkness of the images spoke to me.  I wanted to create a Black and White Nightscape Time-lapse because there is something special about the tonality of the night sky and how it lends itself to being monochromatic. \n\nMany times as photographers we will look at an image that doesn\u2019t look quite right or doesn\u2019t have brilliant lighting and a colorful sunset and say, \u201cI\u2019ll just convert it to black and white to save it.\u201d  However, I have found that usually creates a bland B&W image.  Black and white photos need to invoke emotion without the help of color.  They are pure.  They need to be powerful.  \n\nWhen going through my library to select time-lapses to convert to black and white for this short film, I found that many times clips that looked great in color didn\u2019t work as well in black and white and I actually had to be more selective.\n\nI hope you will take a few minutes to watch this short time-lapse.\n\n_______________________________________\n\n\nPhotography Portfolio: www.aaronkeigherphotography.com\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/akeigher\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/aaronkeigherphotography\n\n_______________________________________\n\n\nLocations in this film include:\nAncient Bristlecone National Forest, CA\nAnza Borrego State Park, CA\nBryce Canyon, UT\nCascade Mountains, WA\nDead Horse Point State Park, UT\nDeath Valley National Park, CA\nGrand Canyon National Park, AZ\nJoshua Tree National Park, CA\nMount Hood, OR\nMount Rainier National Park, WA\nOwens Valley Radio Observatory, CA\nSpouting Horn, Kauai, HI\nTehachapi Pass Wind Farm, CA\nTrona Pinnacles, CA\nYosemite National Park, CA\nZion National Park, UT\n\n_______________________________________\n\n\nAaron Keigher\u2019s Equipment:\nCanon EOS 6D\nSony a7s\nRokinon 14mm f2.8\nCanon 16-35mm f2.8\nCanon 24-105mm f2.8\nRokinon 24mm TS f3.5\nCanon 35mm f2\nCanon 50mm f1.8\nCanon 70-200mm f2.8\nCanon 300mm f4\nEmotimo TB3 Black 3-Axis Motion Controller\nDynamic Perception Stage-R Pan/Tilt Modular Digital System w/NMX Pro Motion Controller \nDynamic Perception Stage-One Slider\n\n\nSoftware Used:\nAdobe After Effects CC\nAdobe Lightroom CC\nAdobe Photoshop CC\nDaVinci Resolve\nFinal Cut Pro X \nGB Deflicker \nLR Timelapse 4\nPhoto Ninja\nNeat Noise\nqDSLR Dashboard",
